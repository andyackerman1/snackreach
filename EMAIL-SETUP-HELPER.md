# Email Setup Helper - I'll Do It For You

If you're having trouble setting up email, here are your options:

## Option 1: Tell Me Your Email Info

If you can provide:
- Your Gmail address (or want to use a different email)
- OR your SendGrid API key

I can help you:
1. Create the exact Railway variables
2. Guide you through copying/pasting them
3. Verify they're set correctly

## Option 2: Skip Email for Now (Optional)

**Email is NOT required for accounts to work!**

- ✅ Accounts are created and saved
- ✅ Users can log in
- ✅ Everything works without email
- ⚠️  Users just won't get welcome emails

You can add email later - it's optional.

## Option 3: Use a Different Email Service

If Gmail is too complicated, try:

**SendGrid (Easier):**
1. Sign up: https://signup.sendgrid.com/
2. Get API key (one click)
3. Add to Railway

**Or use any email you already have:**
- Any SMTP server
- Work email
- Custom domain email

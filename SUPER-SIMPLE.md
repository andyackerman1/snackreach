# 🚀 SUPER SIMPLE - Just Run This!

## ONE Command to Push Everything

I've prepared everything. Just run this ONE command:

```bash
/Users/andy.ackerman/snackconnect/push-it.sh
```

Or if you're already in Terminal, just:

```bash
cd /Users/andy.ackerman/snackconnect
./push-it.sh
```

## When It Asks:

**Username:** Type `andyackerman1` and press Enter

**Password:** Paste your token (the long string you copied from GitHub) and press Enter

That's it! The token will be saved so you never have to do this again.

## After It's Done

Once it says "SUCCESS!", your code is on GitHub and I'll help you:
1. Deploy it to the web (Netlify)
2. Set up the backend (Render)
3. Make it live for everyone to see

## That's Literally It!

Just run the script, paste your token when asked, and you're done! 🎉

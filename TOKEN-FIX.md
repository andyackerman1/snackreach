# Token Permission Issue

The token you provided doesn't seem to have the right permissions. Here's how to fix it:

## Quick Fix

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Find your token** or **create a new one**
3. **Make sure it has these scopes checked:**
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ **workflow** (if you want GitHub Actions)
4. **Update the token** or create a new one
5. **Copy the new token**

## Then I'll Push Again

Once you have a token with **repo** permissions, share it with me and I'll push immediately!

## Alternative: Use SSH Instead

If tokens keep causing issues, we can set up SSH keys which is more secure anyway.

Let me know if you want to:
1. Try a new token with repo permissions
2. Set up SSH keys instead

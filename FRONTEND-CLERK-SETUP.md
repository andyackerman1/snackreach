# Connect Frontend to Clerk - Step by Step

Your backend is already connected to Clerk. Now let's connect your frontend (HTML pages) to Clerk so users can sign up and log in.

## What You Need

1. **Clerk Publishable Key** - Get this from Clerk Dashboard
2. **Update your HTML files** - Add Clerk's JavaScript

## Step 1: Get Your Clerk Publishable Key (1 minute)

1. Go to **https://dashboard.clerk.com**
2. Click **"API Keys"** in the left sidebar
3. Find **"Publishable Key"** (starts with `pk_`)
4. **Copy it** - you'll need it in the next step

## Step 2: Add Clerk to Your HTML Files

I'll update your `signup.html` and `login.html` files to use Clerk's frontend authentication.

### Option A: Use Clerk's Pre-built UI (Easiest - Recommended)

Clerk provides ready-made sign-in and sign-up components that you can drop into your HTML.

### Option B: Keep Your Custom Forms (More Work)

Keep your current forms but connect them to Clerk's authentication.

## Which Do You Prefer?

**Option A (Easiest):**
- Replace your forms with Clerk's beautiful pre-built components
- Less code to maintain
- Automatic password reset, email verification, etc.

**Option B (More Control):**
- Keep your current custom forms
- More work to set up
- Full control over the UI

**I recommend Option A** - it's much easier and Clerk's UI looks great!

## Next Steps

Tell me which option you prefer, and I'll:
1. Update your HTML files
2. Add Clerk's JavaScript
3. Test that everything works

Or I can just set up Option A (the easiest one) for you right now!

# How to Find Your Netlify URL

## Quick Way:

1. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com**
2. You'll see your sites listed
3. Look for **"snackreach"** or your site name
4. The URL will be shown under the site name
5. It looks like: `snackreach-123456.netlify.app` or `snackreach.netlify.app`

## If You Don't See It:

1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check if the site finished deploying (should show "Published" status)
3. The URL is usually: `https://[random-words].netlify.app`

## To Share Your Site:

Once you find it, share it with me and I'll:
- Update the backend API URL
- Make sure everything is connected
- Test it for you

Your Netlify URL should be visible on your dashboard!

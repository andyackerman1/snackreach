✅ ALL CODE PUSHED TO GITHUB

All recent updates including login functionality are now in GitHub.

Railway should auto-deploy, but if you don't see updates:

1. CHECK RAILWAY DASHBOARD:
   - Go to railway.app → Your Project → Deployments
   - Look for latest commit: "Add CSS styles for login page" (6833ee6)
   - Check if deployment status is "Success" or "Failed"

2. MANUAL REDEPLOY (if needed):
   - In Railway dashboard → Deployments tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
   - OR click "Deploy" → "Deploy Latest Commit"

3. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or use incognito/private window

4. VERIFY FILES ARE LIVE:
   - https://snackreach-production.up.railway.app/login.html
   - https://snackreach-production.up.railway.app/signup.html
   - Both should show latest updates

5. CHECK RAILWAY LOGS:
   - Railway dashboard → Service → Logs
   - Look for any errors during deployment

All files are committed and pushed. Railway will deploy automatically!

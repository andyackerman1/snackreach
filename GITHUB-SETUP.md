# GitHub Setup Guide

I'll help you push your SnackReach code to GitHub!

## Option 1: I'll Guide You (Recommended)

I can help you:
1. Create the GitHub repository
2. Push your code
3. Set it up for deployment

## Option 2: Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Account/Login
- Go to: https://github.com
- Sign up or log in

### Step 2: Create New Repository
1. Click the **"+"** icon (top right) → **"New repository"**
2. Name: `snackreach`
3. Description: "B2B marketplace connecting snack startups with office spaces"
4. Choose **Public** (for free hosting) or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have code)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Push Your Code

I can run these commands for you, or you can run them:

```bash
cd /Users/andy.ackerman/snackconnect
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - SnackReach platform"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snackreach.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## What I Can Do For You

I can:
- ✅ Prepare your code for GitHub
- ✅ Create the commit
- ✅ Give you the exact commands to run
- ✅ Help you set up the repository

I cannot:
- ❌ Access your GitHub account directly
- ❌ Create the repository for you (need your login)
- ❌ Push without your authentication

## Ready to Set Up?

Tell me:
1. Do you have a GitHub account?
2. What's your GitHub username?
3. Do you want me to prepare everything and give you the commands?

Then I'll get everything ready for you to push! 🚀
